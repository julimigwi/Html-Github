    <h3>Git Essentials</h3>
    <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system that allows 
        multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously 
        without interfering with each other's changes.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A directory that contains all the files and their history.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A separate line of development in a repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Combining changes from different branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote:</strong> A version of the repository hosted on a server.</li>
        <li><strong>Clone:</strong> Creating a local copy of a remote repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Sending local changes to a remote repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into the local repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Staging Area:</strong> A place where changes are prepared before committing.</li>
        <li><strong>HEAD:</strong> A reference to the current commit in the repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Occurs when changes in different branches cannot be automatically merged.</li>
        <li><strong>Tag:</strong> A marker for a specific commit, often used for releases.</li>
        <li><strong>Fork:</strong> A personal copy of someone else's repository, allowing for independent development.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> A request to merge changes from one branch into another, often used in collaborative projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Cherry-pick:</strong> Applying a specific commit from one branch to another.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebase:</strong> Reapplying commits from one branch onto another, often used to maintain a clean project history.</li>
        <li><strong>Stash:</strong> Temporarily saving changes that are not ready to be committed.</li>
        <li><strong>Blame:</strong> Showing who made changes to each line of a file.</li>
        <li><strong>Revert:</strong> Creating a new commit that undoes changes made by a previous commit.</li>
        <li><strong>Submodule:</strong> A repository nested inside another repository, allowing for modular development.</li>
        <li><strong>Worktree:</strong> A separate working directory for a specific branch, allowing multiple branches to be worked on simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Squash:</strong> Combining multiple commits into a single commit, often used to simplify commit history.</li>
        <li><strong>Bisect:</strong> A method for finding the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.</li>
        <li><strong>Hooks:</strong> Scripts that run at specific points in the Git workflow, allowing for automation of tasks like testing or deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Config:</strong> Settings that control Git's behavior, such as user information and repository settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Alias:</strong> A shortcut for a longer Git command, allowing for easier usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Diff:</strong> A comparison of changes between commits, branches, or files, showing what has been added or removed.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><code>git branch</code>: List branches in the repository.</li>
        <li><code>git checkout [branch]</code>: Switch to a different branch.</li>
        <li><code>git merge [branch]</code>: Merge changes from another branch into the current branch.</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- What I learnt-->
     <!--Understanding GitHub-->
I learned what GitHub is and its main purpose — to allow collaboration among developers on the same project. It helps multiple people contribute to a single codebase efficiently.

<!--Branches in Git-->
I learned about the main branch and how different collaborators can create their own branches, make changes independently, and then update or merge those changes into the main branch.

<!--Common Git Commands-->
I learned several essential Git commands:

git init – to initialize a repository

git add – to stage changes

git commit – to save changes with a message

git push – to upload code to GitHub

git pull – to download updates from GitHub

<!--Power of Networking-->
I learned about the importance of networking, especially through LinkedIn — and how just posting even small projects can help build your profile and attract connections or opportunities.
